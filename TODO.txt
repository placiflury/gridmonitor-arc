 TODO list for Gridmonitor:
---------------------------

- gridadmin view dependency to infocache: 
    . inactive clusters
    . list of giis'es
    . blacklisted clusters 
-> these dependecies need to be made 'infocache' independent.

- report on jobs that got submitted and executed but where not fetched by users -> jobs erased by sites
- make sure db sessions are closed (memory of queries freed) regularily
- limiting number of displayed jobs (or introduce pagination: query.order_by(sa.desc(ng_schema.Cluster.db_lastmodified)).limit(10).all())
- mrtg-plot of in user/overview: display number of jobs, number of gridjobs, number of queued jobs etc.

- RTE search

WARNINGS:

- jobs submitted while cluster is blacklisted are not accounted. (active notification would help).
