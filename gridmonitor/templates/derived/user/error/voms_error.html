<h2> VOMS Error</h2>
<p> An error occured while trying to retrieve your VO credentials. The respective VOMS servers
could not been contacted. <br/>
There are many possible reasons for this, among which also a temporary unavailability of the 
VOMS servers. <br/>
Please try therefore again at a later point in time before reporting the error
to the administrator of this server. <br/><br/>

Thank you very much.  
</p>

<h2> Remedy </h2>
As a user you can't do anything but try again later. As a server administrator you
should give a look to the logs.
