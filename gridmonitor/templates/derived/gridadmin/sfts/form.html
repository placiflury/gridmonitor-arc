<h2> Some more Details </h2>
 The monitoring system can run tests to verify the availability and sanity of the
resources of the Grid. These tests, which are termed site functional tests (SFTs),
are all run under real identities of real users. (If you want to see the involved users
for each test, please take a look on the 'details' menue item associated with each 
SFT.)</br>
</p>

<img src="/img/sft_user.png" alt="Schema how user credentials are used for Site Functional Tests (SFT)" width='450'>
</div>
<div style='width:350px; float:right; vertical-align:top;'>
When a SFT is due to run, the monitoring system fetches a proxy certificate of one of 
the involved users from the MyProxy server. In does this by reading the encrypted 
password from a local database (see figure). </br>
Once it has fetched the proxy certificate, which will be valid for at max 12 hours, it 
will also try to fech the VO membership as specified by the SFT (not shown in the picture.). 
After having successfully fetched the user crendentials, the monitoring system will submit
the test jobs to the specified Grid resource(s).
<h3> What does this mean for You?</h3>
If you are participating in site functional tests, you must upload the certificate you
are using for the test to the MyProxy server (see first part of figure). The upload will 
have to be repeated every time the uploaded certificate is about to expire. </br>
With above form you tell the monitoring system the password with wich it can fetch the 
certificate from the MyProxy server. Notice, the password will be stored, <b>encrypted 
with the monitor's hostkey</b>, in a local database (see middle part of figure).
